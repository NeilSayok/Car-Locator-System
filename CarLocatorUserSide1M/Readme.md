# Car Locator App

This app checks the location of the car and shows its location and last update time on a map.

**For this app you will need a google map api key, which you need to place in CarLocatorUserSide1M/app/src/debug/res/values/google_maps_api.xml inside**

``` <string name="google_maps_key" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">YOUR GOOGLE MAPS API KEY HERE</string>```
